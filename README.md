# mmi-muski-drums
MUSKI Drum Machine exhibit for the Maison des Mathématiques et de l'Informatique (Lyon)

## Installation

Run

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

to build the project. The built files are in the `dist` directory.

## Configuration

The configuration files are in the `config` directory. These typically shouldn't be modified
when installing the app.

You can override any of the configuration keys through a `settings.yml` file in the root directory.

## Development

Run

```bash
npm run watch
```

to watch for changes and rebuild the project.

## Asset Download URLs

During installation, required soundfont and model assets are automatically downloaded and extracted. You can override the download URLs using the following environment variables:

- `MMI_MUSKI_DRUMS_DMX_ZIP_URL`: URL for the dmx.zip file (default: http://exhibits.storage.imaginary.org/mmi-muski-drums/soundfonts/dmx.zip)
- `MMI_MUSKI_DRUMS_DRUMS_RNN_ZIP_URL`: URL for the drums_rnn.zip file (default: http://exhibits.storage.imaginary.org/mmi-muski-drums/checkpoints/drums_rnn.zip)

The corresponding `.sha256` file is always fetched from the same location as the `.zip` file, with `.sha256` appended to the URL. For example, if you set `MMI_MUSKI_DRUMS_DMX_ZIP_URL` to `https://example.com/dmx.zip`, the script will fetch the hash from `https://example.com/dmx.zip.sha256`.

Set these variables before running `npm install` if you need to use alternate asset locations.
